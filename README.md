#🚦 Smart Traffic Management System
Semester 1 Programming Fundamentals Project
##📘 Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System is a console-based C++ application developed as a Semester 1 project for the course Programming Fundamentals.
The project simulates a basic traffic management system used in smart cities, focusing on vehicle registration, traffic monitoring, signal control, emergency handling, and e-challan generation.
This system is designed to demonstrate the practical application of fundamental C++ concepts.

##🎯 Objectives of the Project
•To understand the use of structures in C++
•To practice functions and modular programming
•To implement real-world logic using programming fundamentals
•To simulate a smart traffic control system
•To improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills

##🛠️ Tools & Technologies
•Programming Language: C++
•Compiler: Visual Studio
Concepts Used:
•Structures
•Arrays
•Functions
•Conditional statements
•Loops
•Random number generation
•Formatted output

##🚗 System Features
1️⃣ Vehicle Registration
•Automatically generates a unique registration number
•Stores vehicle owner name and vehicle type (Car/Bike)
2️⃣ Display Registered Vehicles
•Shows all registered vehicles with details
3️⃣ Traffic Status Monitoring
•Simulates live traffic in different areas
•Displays vehicle count per area
4️⃣ Smart Signal Control
•Adjusts green signal timing based on traffic density
•More vehicles → longer green time
5️⃣ Emergency Vehicle Detection
•Detects emergency vehicles (Ambulance, Fire Brigade, Police)
•Gives priority green signal to the emergency route
6️⃣ Signal Status Display
•Shows current signal color, green time, and vehicle count
7️⃣ E-Challan Generation
•Generates electronic challans for traffic violations
•Stores challan ID, violation type, and fine amount
8️⃣ Challan Inquiry System
•Allows users to check challans using their name

##🎓 Learning Outcomes
After completing this project, I learned:
•How to design a menu-driven program
•How to use structures to store related data
•How to apply programming concepts to real-world problems
•How to write clean and modular C++ code
