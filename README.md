🚦 Smart Traffic Management System (C++)
Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System is a console-based C++ application developed as a first semester  project for the course Computer Programming.
The project simulates a basic traffic management system used in smart cities, focusing on vehicle registration, traffic monitoring, signal control, emergency handling, and e-challan generation.

This system is designed to demonstrate the practical application of fundamental C++ concepts.
Objectives of the Project
To understand the use of structures in C++
To practice functions and modular programming
To implement real-world logic using programming fundamentals
To simulate a smart traffic control system
To improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills
