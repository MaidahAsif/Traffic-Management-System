# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System  
### Semester 1 – Computer Programming Project

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Smart Traffic Management System** is a **console-based C++ application** developed as a **Semester 1 project** for the course **Programming Fundamentals**.

The project simulates a basic traffic management system used in smart cities, focusing on:
- Vehicle registration
- Traffic monitoring
- Signal control
- Emergency handling
- E-challan generation

This system demonstrates the **practical application of fundamental C++ concepts**.

## 🚗 System Features

### 1️⃣ Vehicle Registration
- Automatically generates a unique registration number
- Stores vehicle owner name and vehicle type (Car/Bike)

### 2️⃣ Display Registered Vehicles
- Shows all registered vehicles with details

### 3️⃣ Traffic Status Monitoring
- Simulates live traffic in different areas
- Displays vehicle count per area

### 4️⃣ Smart Signal Control
- Adjusts green signal timing based on traffic density
- More vehicles → longer green time

### 5️⃣ Emergency Vehicle Detection
- Detects emergency vehicles (Ambulance, Fire Brigade, Police)
- Gives priority green signal to the emergency route

### 6️⃣ Signal Status Display
- Shows current signal color, green time, and vehicle count

### 7️⃣ E-Challan Generation
- Generates electronic challans for traffic violations
- Stores challan ID, violation type, and fine amount

### 8️⃣ Challan Inquiry System
- Allows users to check challans using their name
